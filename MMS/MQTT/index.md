# MQTT
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol optimized for devices with limited bandwidth, low power, and high latency environments. It operates on a publish/subscribe model, where a MagTek payment device publishes data to a topic, and other computing devices (e.g., mobile phones and tablets) subscribed to that topic receive the data. This ensures efficient data transfer with minimal overhead, making it ideal for IoT and real-time communication.

DynaFlex II PED supports native MQTT where other MagTek MMS devices require the use of the MMS Device Client.
