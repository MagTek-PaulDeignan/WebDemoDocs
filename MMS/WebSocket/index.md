# WebSocket

**WebSocket** is a communication protocol that enables two-way, real-time communication between a client (like a web browser) and a server over a single, persistent connection, unlike traditional HTTP which uses a request-response model. 

**DynaFlex II PED** supports native WebSocket providing full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection.
