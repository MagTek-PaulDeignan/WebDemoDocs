# MagTek MQTT Magensa Local Start Demo ‚Äì User Instructions

## Overview

This [MQTT Magensa Local Start Demo](https://rms.magensa.net/TEST/demo/mmsUnigateLocalStart.html) enables users to initiate and process MPPG transactions using the **Local Start** mode on a MagTek **DynaFlex II PED**. The device must be configured to use native MQTT messaging or connected via the Web HID MQTT Client. The interface displays real-time communication logs, shows device connection status, and provides controls for configuring the PED's transaction behavior.

> **Note:** The DynaFlex II PED must be configured for **Mode 1B (Local Start)**, where transactions begin from the PED‚Äôs screen instead of a POS application.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following:

- A compatible MagTek device (DynaFlex II PED) configured for MQTT or connected via Web HID.
- USB-C cable for device power and communication (if using Web HID).
- Chromium-based browser (e.g., Chrome or Edge) for Web HID functionality.
- Internet connectivity to load demo assets.
- Web HID permissions granted to access USB-connected devices (browser will prompt).

## Interface Elements

### 1. **Device Display Area**
- **Location:** Beneath the page heading.
- **Purpose:** Displays the current UI status or messaging from the PED.

### 2. **Log Data Output**
- **Element ID:** `LogData`
- **Purpose:** Shows real-time logs of communication and transaction feedback.
- **Use:** Monitor device activity, configuration commands, and processor responses.

### 3. **Connection Status**
- **Icon Indicator:** Displays either connected or disconnected status.
- **Label Text:** Updates dynamically to ‚ÄúConnected‚Äù or ‚ÄúDisconnected‚Äù based on the current state.

## Configure Transaction Modes

Use the buttons to configure how the PED starts a transaction:

### üü¶ `Configure Local Start`
- Sets the device to initiate transactions from its touchscreen UI.
- No POS interaction is needed to start a sale.
- Required for this demo to function properly.

### üü¶ `Configure Standard Start`
- Returns the device to host-initiated (POS-driven) transaction mode.
- **Note:** This demo does not support Standard Start for live transactions.
