# Magensa Services

**Unigate** is Magensa's API for omni-commerce financial transaction processing, supporting both card-present and card-not-present payments via **MPPG V5** or later.

It simplifies development for ISVs by normalizing request and response data, securely storing transaction records, and enabling seamless integration with both MagTek and non-MagTek hardware. By making processor-specific differences invisible to the developer, the Unigate API allows ISVs to connect to multiple payment processors using a single, unified code baseâ€”modernizing and streamlining the developer experience.

These demos incorporate both MagTek devices, and Magensa MPPG v5 with UniGate, to demonstrate various point of sale transactions for attended and semi-attended use cases.
